            <p>     Cutting Edge is a landscaping business based in Kennesaw, GA. Cutting Edge is a platform that offers landscaping services independently, 
                so you pick and choose which services you need. All scheduling and transactions are done via the Cutting Edge website, which contains a convenient
                tool that allows you to schedule your landscaping needs. With everything from weekly services like mowing, to seasonal needs like pressure washing,
                Cutting Edge offers a variety of options for you. Cutting Edge has a unique pricing system built in, so we only charge you for services that are needed in your lawn. 
                These services are designed so you pay for precisely what you need, rather than a fixed budget for services that may or may not be needed. </p>
