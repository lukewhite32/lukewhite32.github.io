            <p>Meet me: Luke White (often referred to as Pookie, don't ask). I'm (currently) a 13 year old who has a passion for programming. I'm currently member of <a href="http://firestormrobotics.org/">Firestorm Robotics</a>, <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> team 6341. I first started programming when my dad bought me a Python book. I loved it, but after I had completed the book, I didn't know how to continue programming. Fast forward to September of 2022 when a friend invited me to join a local robotics club. I was eager to join, not knowing what to expect of the club.</p>
            <h1 id="firestorm-robotics-header">My time with Firestorm Robotics</h1>
            <p>When I first walked into the <a href="cherokeemakerspace.org">robotics building</a>, I looked around in awe and knew this was my kind of place. The lead programmer met me and eventually got me started on C++. Being a young programmer who only had some Python experience, C++ seemed <i>really</i> complicated. But after a few months, I was pretty fluent with it. So, when the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zpflsYc4PA">2023 FRC season</a> came up, I felt ready to finally help out with the robot code. We all knew that this game would be code-reliant, and with our design, complicated math. </p>
            <p>There were many times when we felt like giving up, and while I didn't spend nearly as much time as others, we had a lot of times where we spend all day refining and debugging the robot. Finally, the night before the competition, we discovered something devestating.</p>
