        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my currently ugly site. I am essentially renovating this site right now. For now you can check on my current project <a href="cutting-edge/home.html">Cutting Edge</a>, a mock website for a landscaping company that I made up. Be sure to check back in a few weeks and I should have some more stuff here</p>
