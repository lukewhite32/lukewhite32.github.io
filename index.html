            <h2>Welcome to Randomness</h2>
            <p>I'm Luke White, I dabble in mechatronics engineering and web development, and I play sports. Since I don't know what to put here, I am dedicating this site to complete randomness. There will be random games, tools, and possibly blog posts. I doubt anyone will find their way here (except maybe some friends), but if you do, feel free to look around. Enjoy!</p>

                <h2 class="proj-desc">PML</h3>
                <p><a href="https://stashey13.github.io">PML (PDF Markup Language)</a> is a markup language intended to ease the creation of PDFs. It uses tags named similarly to those in HTML, but uses a slightly different syntax. It allows for styling and IDs, as well as forms like checkboxes and text inputs. We (me and a friend) are working on an app that has a built-in text editor and the ability to export PML as a PDF. This project is currently under construction, so make sure to check back once it is completed.</p>
