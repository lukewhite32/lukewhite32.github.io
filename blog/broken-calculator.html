            <h2>Back Story</h2>
            <p>
                One day, Shep (my friend) texts me and tells me that he dropped his TI-83+ and the LCD shattered. The screen was barely functional, with half of the screen covered by a big crack with fluid
                in it. Since I have 2 calculators (a TI-83+ and TI-84+), he asked if I could transplant the screen from my 83+ to his. Sure, I said, how hard could it be?
            </p>

                Turns out I was completely wrong. Of course, Texas Instruments decides to have the screen attach to the motherboard via a ribbon cable with adhesive. So, once you peel that cable off, you either have to line it up
                or solder the connections together via wire.

                Ok... so just line up the ribbon cable and secure it somehow. So, I tried that... many times. I tried using scotch tape to line up both sides of the ribbon cable, but I'm not even getting power. There's no way I'm soldering to that connector
                either, since the pads are so small. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So, for now, I guess I'm just using my old calculator...
