           <p>
            Well, it was an exciting season. We far exceeded our own expectations. While we performed very well, there is still a lot we need to learn.
           </p>
           <h2>Worlds</h2>
           <p>Worlds was a great experience for me. Just walking onto that stage was a privilege and the energy was great. Going into it, I didn't know what to expect. I just hoped and prayed that our robot
            would function to its best potential, and whatever happened happened. I was more stressed out for this competition specifically, not just cause it is worlds but also cause we were spending a lot of time
            on spring break trying to piece everything together. This was a result of poor time management, but I will possibly cover that in a different blog post. Anyway, when we first loaded in, it was a crazy experience
            seeing all the 256 teams there; teams from around the world that all share the same interest and passion. Here were quite literally the best teams in the world, and we get to compete with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, we loaded in everything and did the finishing touches on the robot that night in the hotel. Everything seemed to be working fine. 
           </p>
           <h2>First Matches</h2>
           <p>
            Our first match was very nerve wracking (to be expected). Our auto got 4/6 samples, a pretty acceptable score. But then, we had some teleop problems. This was really a result of lack of driver practice, because 
            Waylon had problems with the light indicator modes that we weren't able to flesh out before comp. Not to mention we were allianced with a team that <i>had no auto</i>. So, we probably would've lost, regardless of how we performed as a team.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our next two matches were very disappointing. Our transfer failed in auto both times, leaving us with a very low score by the end of auto. Then we struggled with teleop problems the rest of the matches. By the end of the third match, I was very 
            dejected. First three matches at worlds and we had lost all of them, and our robot still had issues.
           </p>
           <p>Well, we took a lunch break and found out that our hard stop for our transfer had messed up somehow. A screw had been misplaced somehow. So, after fixing that, we went to the practice fields. Oh by the way, I had no idea
            that they only give you <i>fifteen minutes</i> per practice field slot. So we had to finish our slot then race to get back in line. Anyway, we tested auto and teleop and the transfer seems to be completely fine.
           </p>
           <h2>Some hope...</h2>
           <p>
            Finally, our auto was actually transferring successfully. Our next few matches were pretty fun, and we finally got our act together. We still lost most of the matches due to <i>very unfortunate</i> match scheduling, but at least our robot could actually 
            perform. We even got a 390 score with a team from India, which was a good feeling. But then...
           </p>
           <h2>The Crash</h2>
           <p>
            Well, thanks yet again REV robotics. For costing us 2 of our matches. For <i>two</i> of the matches we played in, our rev control hub randomly crashed in the middle of autonomous. Nothing to do with my code, nothing I could've done. Just the control hub having some sort of firmware bug. 
            Well, we couldn't even enable teleop either, which was the weird part about the error. So that said goodbye to two of our matches. 
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point, we were all demoralized, seeing our team number show up as 62nd out of 64th. The rest of the competition went alright, auto worked and everything, but a combination of initial struggles with our robot, the stupid rev hub, AND the fact our alliances' average OPR was like 50, led to us ending worlds with 62nd place.
           </p>
           <p>62nd place. And yet Gear Wizards, a team that could do only samples and no specimens, AND a team that had a verrry inconsistent sample auto, was ranked way higher than us. So naturally they get picked for the playoffs, even though we had an equally, if not better, auto and teleop than them. So thanks a lot random number generator</p>
           <h2>Takeaways</h2>
           <p>
            Probably the biggest takeaway from worlds was this: better time management. Our states bot was great (there's a reason it won states). And many aspects of the states bot needed to be changed. However, we changed so much that we didn't have enought time to fully flesh out all the bugs to get it competition ready. Most of our problems could've been
            avoided had we spent more time running practice matches.  
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone is going to have problems at worlds-- in fact, a lot of teams did. But our problems could've been fixed with better time management. Overall, I am very happy with this season. As a second year team, we blew even our own expectations. I am also very excited for next season and all the ways we can improve.
