            <p>     Cutting Edge is a landscaping business based in Kennesaw, GA. Cutting Edge is a platform that offers landscaping services independently, 
                so you pick and choose which services you need. All scheduling and transactions are done via the Cutting Edge website, which contains a convenient
                tool that allows you to schedule your landscaping needs. With everything from weekly services like mowing, to seasonal needs like pressure washing,
                Cutting Edge offers a variety of options for you. Cutting Edge has a unique pricing system built in, so we only charge you for services that are needed in your lawn. 
                These services are designed so you pay for precisely what you need, rather than a fixed budget for services that may or may not be needed. </p>

                    <h2>Mowing</h2>
                    <p>Good mowing is essential to every lawn. At Cutting Edge, we provide flexible mowing options that best suit your lawn. 
                        We provide options for discharge methods to use on your lawn, or we can decide based on your lawn's current condition. 
                        We also provide control over your grass length, so your lawn looks exactly how you like it. At 
                        Cutting Edge, we use electric lawn mowers, ensuring quiet performance.</p>

                    <h2>Edging And Weed Whacking</h2>
                    <p>Edging is crucial for maintaining a consistent edge on your grass. As well as offering edging services, we also offer weed control 
                        services, so the cracks in your pavement stay free of weeds. Similar to mowing, we also use electric tools for this process, which keeps
                        noice levels at a minimum.

                    <h2>Blowing</h2>
                    <p>Having a leaf-free lawn is important; not only for looks, but ensuring that no dead grass patches form. We use a high power gasoline blower that 
                        keeps leaves off your lawn as well as keeping your pavement clear.
